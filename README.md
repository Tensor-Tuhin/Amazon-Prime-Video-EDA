# Amazon-Prime-Video-EDA
Exploratory Data Analysis for the contents of Amazon Prime Video library

This project analyses the Amazon Prime Video library to understand patterns and trends in content type, age certification, content ratings and more.

    The dataset contains metadata on shows and movies from 1912 to 2022, including features such as runtime, genres, production countries, their type and ratings.

    The methods used for analysis:
    - Data cleaning.
    - Grouping and binning data.
    - EDA using various visualisation techniques.

    Limitations:
    - Many shows/movies did not have any entries of age certification which could have been useful if present.

    Key Findings:
    - Demand for movies is greater than shows.
    - R-rated and PG-13-rated contents are very popular in this platform.
    - The average rating of shows (as per IMDb and TMDB scores) are better than movies.
    - Demand for English language based content is higher.
